# Guide to building the Ninchat iOS SDK

This document describes the steps to take when developing, updating and releasing the Ninchat iOS SDK.

The library has been written in Objective-C, provinding a thin layer around a wrapped Golang SDK that has been built as a static Framework for iOS use.

The library is being published using Cocoapods, the de-facto standard dependency manager for iOS.

## Development

When developing the SDK, pay attention to the existing coding style and follow the same conventions.
